# Jakub Szczypek — QA Automation Engineer

Hi 👋  
I’m a QA Automation Engineer focused on building scalable UI and API automation frameworks.  
I work mainly with Java, Selenium, and RestAssured, and I’m interested in test architecture, clean code, and engineering best practices.

I treat automation as software engineering — not just testing.
